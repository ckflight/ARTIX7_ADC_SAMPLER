# ARTIX7_ADC_SAMPLER

Artix 7 vhdl design for adc data sampler up to 10 MSPS speed with to be used with the Radar.
Higher sampling rates is benefitial for lower adc noise floor which can be seen from the equation SNR =  SNR(adc) + 10log(framp * fsampling)

To test adc data counter is used.

Kicad files for adc sampler board design with max1426, spartan 7 or artix 7 fpga and ft2232h ic will be included in near future stay tuned!
